# Business Tracker Demo Site
This site is a demo to help prospective users picture how they would like a similar site custom created for them. The site serves as one big graphic interface for a company's data so everyone can use the database without special training.

In this demo, the models are set up to be used by a service provider who works with brokers to deliver services to customers. A specific service provider could have a similar setup customized to include all the fields they need to be able to reference for their customers and brokers and to create tasks, send reminders, or auto-update fields in response to changes.
